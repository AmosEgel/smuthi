SMUTHI
=======================
SMUTHI means 'Scattering by MUltiple particles in THIn-film systems'. The software allows to simulate light scattering
by multiple particles near (or between) planar interfaces. It is based on the T-matrix method for the single particle
scattering, and on the scattering-matrix method for the propagation through the layered medium.

Target group: Scientists and engineers in the field of optics and optoelectronics
