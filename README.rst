SMUTHI stands for 'scattering by multiple particles in thin-film systems'. The software allows to simulate light
scattering by multiple particles near (or between) planar interfaces. It is based on the T-matrix method for the single
particle scattering, and on the scattering-matrix method for the propagation through the layered medium.
