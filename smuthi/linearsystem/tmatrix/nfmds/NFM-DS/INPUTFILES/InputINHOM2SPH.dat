Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by an 
inhomogeneous sphere with radius r = 1.0 micrometer. The spherical inclusion 
has the radius r1 = 0.5 micrometer and its axial position is given by 
z1 = 0.25 micrometer. The relative refractive index of the host sphere 
with respect to the ambient medium is 1.33, while the relative refractive
index of the inclusion with respect to the host sphere is 1.127819549. 
Convergence is achieved for Nrank = 20 and Nrank1 = 13.
