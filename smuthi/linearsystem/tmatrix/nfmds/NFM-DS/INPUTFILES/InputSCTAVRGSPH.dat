Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering
of an ensemble of polydisperse, homogeneous spherical particles  with a
gamma size distribution of parameters alpha = 0.6 and gamma = 0.2 The truncated 
size distribution is characterized by amin = 5.0 micrometer and amax = 20.0    
micrometer, and the relative refractive of the particles is (1.53,0.008).
