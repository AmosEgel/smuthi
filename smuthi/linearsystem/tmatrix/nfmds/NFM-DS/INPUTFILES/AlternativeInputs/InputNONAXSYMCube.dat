Variables:
- perfectcond - if perfectcond = t, the particle is perfectly conducting.
- anisotropic - if anisotropic = t, the particle is a uniaxial anisotropic 
                crystal. 
- chiral      - if chiral = t, the particle is optical active.   
- kb          - parameter of chirality.

Variables:
- FileGeom   - if FileGeom = t, the particle geometry is supplied by the 
               input file FileFEM.
- FileFEM    - name of the file containing the particle geometry.			        
- TypeGeom   - parameter specifying the type of the particle geometry.
- Nsurf      - number of surface parameters. 
- surf(1)    - surface parameter.
- ...
- surf(Nsurf)		       
- Nparam     - number of smooth surfaces forming the particle surface.
- anorm      - characteristic length of the particle which is used to 
               normalize the differential scattering cross sections.
- Rcirc      - characteristic length of the particle which is used to 
               compute an estimate of Nrank.
- miror      - if miror = t, the particle is mirror symmetric.
- Nazimutsym - number of azimuthal symmetric sections.
NOTE: FOR CHIRAL AND ANISOTROPIC PARTICLES SET miror = f. FURTHERMORE,
FOR ANISOTROPIC PARTICLES, A REGULAR N-HEDRAL PRISM (TypeGeom = 3) 
IS NOT A VALID GEOMETRY, AND THEREFORE SET Nazimutsym = 0.

                angles ranging from 0° to 180° in the azimuthal plane

Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by a cube with 
half-lenght surf(1) = surf(2) = 0.2 micrometer, at a wavelength of 0.2 * Pi
micrometer. Only dielectric and perfectly conducting particles can be 
computed with Nrank = 8, Mrank = 6, and Nint1 = 48 and Nint2 = 24.  If 
FileGeom = .false., the particle geometry is generated by the routines 
contain in the file GeomLib.f90. The option FileGeom =.true., causes 
the code to read the particle geometry information from the file FileFEM = 
'../GEOMFILES/cube.fem'.
