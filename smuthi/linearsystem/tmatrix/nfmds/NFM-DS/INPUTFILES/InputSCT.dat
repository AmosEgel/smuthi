Comment  
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate the scattering 
characteristics for an incomplete PDF. The incident wave is a 
plane wave propagating along the Z-axis, and a single orientation of 
the particle (characterized by alpha = beta = 45 °, gamma = 0° ) is 
considered. The DSCS is computed for a linearly polarized vector plane 
wave in the azimuthal plane phiGS = 0° and at NthetaGS = 181 scattering 
angles. The phase matrix is calculated at Nphi = 2 scattering planes
characterized by the azimuthal angles phi(1) = 45° and phi(2) = 225°.
In the first and second scattering plane, 3 zenith angles uniformly 
spaced in the intervals [30°,150°] and [30°,150°], respectively, 
are considered.         

If the routine SCT.90 is called, the input file is setup to calculate 
scattering characteristics of a prolate spheroid. The T matrix of the 
spheroid is stored in the file '../TMATFILES/TProlA10B5.dat' and 
Nrank = 20 and Mrank = 7.
