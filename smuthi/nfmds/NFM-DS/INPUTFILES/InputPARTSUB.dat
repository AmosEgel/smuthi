Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by a prolate 
spheroid with half-axes surf(1) = 0.05 micrometer and surf(2) = 0.025 
micrometer, at a wavelength of 0.488 micrometer. The particle with a relative 
refractive index of (4.37,0.08) is situated at the distance z0 = 0.05 
micrometer below a substrate with a relative refractive index ind_refSUB = 
(4.37,0.08). The  spheroid is illuminated by a vector plane wave traveling 
in the ambient medium. The incident angle is beta = 45°  and the polarization  
angle is alphap = 45°. The differential scattering cross sections are 
computed in the azimuthal plane phiGS = 0° at NthetaGS = 181 zenith angles, 
while the electromagnetic fields are computed in the azimuthal plane 
phi(1) = 0° at 91 zenith angles. Convergence is achieved for Nint = 60,
NXint = 60 and Nrank = 10.
