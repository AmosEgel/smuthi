               input file FileFEM.

Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by an 
ellipsoid with half-axes surf(1) = 0.2 micrometer, surf(2) = 0.25 micrometer 
and surf(3) = 0.3 micrometer, at a wavelength of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. 
Because FileGeom = f, the particle geometry is generated by the routines 
contain in the file GeomLib.f90. The input values Nrank = 6, Mrank = 4
and Nint1 = Nint2 = 24 can also be used for perfectly conducting and
chiral particles. For an anisotropic particle use Mrank = 5.
