Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by a 
cluster of spheres with radius r = 0.03 micrometer, at a wavelength 
of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. The number of spherical particles is Npart = 
50, while the maximum expansion and azimuthal orders of the particles 
are Nrank = 3 and Mrank = 3. Two auxiliary surfaces of radii 0.27 
micrometer and 0.35 micrometer are considered.
