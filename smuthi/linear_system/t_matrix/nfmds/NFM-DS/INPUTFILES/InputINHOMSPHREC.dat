Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by an 
inhomogeneous sphere with radius Rcirc = 0.35 micrometer, at a wavelength 
of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. The inclusions are spheres with radius r = 0.03 
micrometer. The number of spherical inclusions is Npart = 50, while the 
maximum expansion and azimuthal orders of the inclusion are Nrank = 3 and 
Mrank = 3. Three auxiliary surfaces of radii 0.22, 0.27 and 0.35 micrometer 
are considered.
