Installing Python
-------------------

Under Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can for example use WinPython: 

  * Download WinPython from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython 
  * Run the WinPython installer. It will extract a fully portable python environment to a specified location (it can even be a USB stick). 
  * Open the WinPython installation folder and run the "WinPython Command Prompt". 
    This is the command window in which you have Python and pip available, such that you can run the commands described below. 

Under Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install Python 3 open a shell and type::

   sudo apt-get install python3
