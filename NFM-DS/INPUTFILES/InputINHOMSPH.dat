Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by an 
inhomogeneous sphere with radius  r = 1.0 micrometer, at a wavelength of
0.2 * Pi micrometer. The T matrix of the inclusion is read from the file 
FileTmat = '../TMATFILES/TProlA5B3.dat'. The maximum expansion and 
azimuthal orders of the inclusion are Nrank1 = 13 and Mrank1 = 5. The 
inclusion is a prolate spheroid with surf(1) = 0.5 micrometer and 
surf(2) = 0.3 micrometer. The relative refractive index of the host 
particle is 1.2, while the relative refractive index of the inclusion 
with respect to the ambient medium is 1.5. The position of the inclusion 
with respect to the coordinate system of the host sphere is given by 
x1 = y1 = z1 = 0.0. The Euler angles are alpha1 = beta1 = 45° deg and 
gamma1 = 0°. Convergence is achieved for Nrank = 20 and Mrank = 13.
