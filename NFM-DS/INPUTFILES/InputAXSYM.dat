Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by a prolate 
spheroid with half-axes surf(1) = 1.0 micrometer and surf(2) = 0.5 micrometer, 
at a wavelength of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. Although, the particle is assumed 
to be dielectric, perfectly conducting and chiral particles can be computed
with the same value of Nrank and the same distribution of sources. Convergence
is achieved for Nrank = 19 and Nint = 100. For dielectric particles, the
maximum expansion order can be chosen as Nrank = 17. If FileGeom = f, the 
particle geometry is generated by the routines contained in the file 
'GeomLib.f90'. The option FileGeom = t, causes the code to read the particle 
geometry information from the file FileFEM = '../GEOMFILES/prolate.fem'.
