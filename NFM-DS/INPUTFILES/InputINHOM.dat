Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by an 
inhomogeneous spheroid with half-axes surf(1) = 1.0 micrometer and  
surf(2) = 0.8 micrometer, at a wavelength of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. 
The T matrix of the inclusion is read from the file FileTmat = 
'../TMATFILES/TProlA5B3.dat', and the maximum expansion and azimuthal 
orders of the inclusion are Nrank1 = 13 and Mrank1 = 5. The inclusion 
is a prolate spheroid with surf(1) = 0.5 micrometer and surf(2) = 0.3 
micrometer. The relative refractive index of the host particle is 1.2, 
while the relative refractive index of the inclusion with respect to 
the ambient medium is 1.5. The position of the inclusion with respect 
to the coordinate system of the host sphere is given by x1 = 0.0, 
y1 = 0.0 and z1 = 0.3 micrometer, while the Euler orientation angles 
are alpha1 = beta1 = gamma1 = 0°. Convergence is achieved for Nrank = 20, 
Mrank = 18 and Nint = 200.
