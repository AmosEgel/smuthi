Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by five 
identical spheres of radii rPart = 0.2 micrometer, at a wavelength of 
0.2 * Pi micrometer. The maximum expansion and azimuthal orders of the 
particles are NrankPart = 6 and MrankPart = 4. The particles are situated 
at the center, on the x-axis (xPart  =  0.6 micrometer and xPart = 
- 0.6 micrometer) and on the y-axis (yPart  = 0.6 micrometer and 
yPart = -0.6 micrometer) of the cluster coordinate system. Convergence
is achieved for Nrank = 18 and Mrank = 16.
