Comment 
As provided, the file InputEFMED.dat is setup to calculate the effective
wave number for spherical particles with a size parameter ranging
from 0.01 to 2.5 in steps of 0.063846154. The relative refractive index 
of the spherical particles with respect to the ambient medium is
(1.8,0.05). The results are written to the file '../OUTPUTFILES/Output.dat'.
