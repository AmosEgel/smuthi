This directory contains alternative input files for nonaxisymmetric particles,
particles on or near a plane substrate and for computing the scattering 
characteristics. To become valid input files for the code, these files must
be renamed as the standard input files contained in the directory 
INPUTFILES. For instance, the file "INPUTFILES/AlternativeInputs/InputNONAXSYMCube.dat"
will overwrite the file "INPUTFILES/InputNONAXSYM.dat".
