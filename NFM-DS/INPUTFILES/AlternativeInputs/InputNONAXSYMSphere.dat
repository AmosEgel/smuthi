Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by a sphere 
with radius = surf(1) = surf(2) = surf(3) = 0.29998 micrometer, at a 
wavelength of 0.2 * Pi micrometer. Dielectric, perfectly conducting,
chiral and anisotropic particles can be computed with Nrank = 6, 
Mrank = 4 and Nint1 = Nint2 = 24. If FileGeom = .false., the particle  
geometry is generated by the routines contain in the file GeomLib.f90. 
The option  FileGeom  = .true., causes the code to read the particle 
geometry information from the file FileFEM = '../GEOMFILES/sphere.fem'.
