Comment
As provided, the input file is setup to calculate scattering by two 
identical spheres of radii rp  = 0.3 micrometer, at a wavelength of 
0.2 * Pi micrometer. The maximum expansion order of the particles is 
Nrankp = 8. The axial positions of the particles with respect to the 
coordinate system of the cluster are given by zp = 0.35 micrometer and 
zp = -0.35 micrometer. Convergence is achieved for Nrank = 16.
